## üöÄ Get Started

Getting started with the Angelic project is incredibly easy. Follow these simple steps to set up and run Angelic on your system:

### 1. Requirements
* Linux, Mac OS, or [WSL on Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) >= 3.11
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) >= 18.17.1

### 2. Build and Setup The Environment

- **Build the Project:** Begin by building the project, which includes setting up the environment and installing dependencies. This step ensures that Angelic is ready to run smoothly on your system.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    playwright install 

    playwright install --with-deps
    
    cd ui

    playwright install --with-deps
    ```

### 3. Configuring the Language Model

Angelic supports a diverse array of Language Models (LMs) through the powerful. By default, we've chosen the mighty GPT-4 from OpenAI as our go-to model, but the world is your oyster! You can unleash the potential of Anthropic's suave Claude, the enigmatic Llama, or any other LMM's that piques your interest.

To configure the LM of your choice, follow these steps:

1. **Using Sample.config.toml:**
   Find the sample.config.toml and rename it to config.toml and fill up the Api's to get the project to start working .

2. **Install Bun :** 
    Install bun as it is needed for the ui interface of the project. To install this follow the steps:

    ```bash
    Make sure you open your powershell windows in admin mode . Once done open copy and paste this code there:

    For windows :

    powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1|iex"
    
    set this as an env variable :C:\Users\<UserName>\.bun\bin

    For mac , Lunix , Wsl:

    curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

    ```

3. **Installing Node Modules**: there are steps to install the node modules :

```bash
npm install

npm i playwright

npm i playwright-core
```



**Note on Alternative Models:**


### 4. Run the Application

- **Run the Application:** Once the setup is complete, launching Angelic is as simple as running a single command. This command starts both the backend and frontend servers seamlessly, allowing you to interact with Angelic without any hassle.


### 5. Individual Server Startup

- **Start the Backend Server:** If you prefer, you can start the backend server independently to focus on backend-related tasks or configurations.
    ```bash
    python angelic.py
    ```

- **Start the Frontend Server:** Similarly, you can start the frontend server on its own to work on frontend-related components or interface enhancements.
    ```bash
    cd ui

    bun run dev

    if any errors comes try setting this as as your env path : 
    
    C:\Program Files\Node-js\node_modules\corepack\shims\nodewin\ 

    ```
